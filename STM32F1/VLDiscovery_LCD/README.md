## STM32VLDiscovery STM32F100RBT (STM32F1xx)
I bought this board when it first came out (was that over 10-15 years ago for AU $12 ?),but never did much with it due to time. Whilst the WeAct32F411 was with the courier I did an initial prototype for a client with this board. Quite simple, just a couple of PWM used to glow the LEDs and control a vacuum controlled solenoid connected to a 2" butterfly valve. Worked a treat.
The board definition includes all pins associated with an LCD board expansion kit: EB-STM32DISCOVERY-LCD
The expansion board has build in LED backlight driver circuit and 60pin FPC connector for the Kentec LCDs
