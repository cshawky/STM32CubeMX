## STM32F411VETx
This is an LQFP100 package for the STM32F4. I picked this as it was an available stock item from https://jlcpcb.com/ a site I randomly came across that provided what appears to be a good PCB manufacture and component assembly service. The STM32F411CEU6 was not available. The advantage of the VE series and LQFP100 is the expanded pin count. I find the Black Pill suffers on physical IO availability. The VLDiscovery was a much better IO combination. As is the STM32H750VBT6 below.
